# khufu_ror Template Repo

This is a Rails 8.0 ready-to-go template repo. It follows the Github definition of what a template repo is and may not be confused with a Rails app template.

# How to use

1. Create a new repo from this template
   1. Conventionaly, the name of your choice will also define the name of the rails application
2. Clone that repo locally
3. Run `script/rename-ror` to rename all references of the template repo to your new app name
   1. This will also update the `README.md` file you are now reading with the original Rails one.
4. Follow the updated README.md instructions to get started
